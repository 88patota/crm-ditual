## Commission Structure Overview

### Commission Brackets

The system uses **7 distinct profitability ranges** with progressively higher commission rates:

| Profitability Range | Commission Rate | Business Logic |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **< 20%** | **0%** | Low margin items - no commission |
| **20% - 30%** | **1%** | Standard margin - basic commission |
| **30% - 40%** | **1.5%** | Good margin - intermediate commission |
| **40% - 50%** | **2.5%** | High margin - increased commission |
| **50% - 60%** | **3%** | Very high margin - premium commission |
| **60% - 80%** | **4%** | Excellent margin - high commission |
| **≥ 80%** | **5%** | Exceptional margin - maximum commission |

### Visual Representation

```
Profitability  →  Commission Rate
    0-20%     →      0%    (No commission)
   20-30%     →      1%    ██
   30-40%     →     1.5%   ███
   40-50%     →     2.5%   █████
   50-60%     →      3%    ██████
   60-80%     →      4%    ████████
    ≥80%      →      5%    ██████████ (Maximum)
```

## Calculation Methodology

### 1. Profitability Calculation
```
Profitability = (Sale_Value_Without_Taxes / Purchase_Value_Without_Taxes) - 1
```

**Example:**
- Purchase Value: R$ 100.00 (without taxes)
- Sale Value: R$ 150.00 (without taxes)
- Profitability: (150 / 100) - 1 = 0.50 = **50%**

### 2. Commission Rate Determination
The system automatically identifies which bracket the profitability falls into and applies the corresponding commission rate.

### 3. Commission Value Calculation
```
Commission_Value = Total_Sale_Value × Commission_Percentage
```

**Example:**
- Total Sale Value: R$ 2,000.00
- Profitability: 50% → Commission Rate: 3%
- Commission Value: R$ 2,000.00 × 0.03 = **R$ 60.00**

## Advanced Features

### Quantity Adjustment Rule

The system includes a **sophisticated handling** for cases where sold quantity differs from purchased quantity:

- **Standard Method**: Used when sold quantity = purchased quantity
- **Quantity-Adjusted Method**: Used when quantities differ
  - Calculates profitability based on total operation values
  - Ensures commission reflects the real transaction value

### Budget-Level Calculations

For complete budgets, the system provides:

1. **Total Commission**: Sum of all item commissions
2. **Commission by Bracket**: Breakdown by profitability ranges
3. **Item Summary**: Detailed view of each item's commission
4. **Validation Reports**: Complete audit trail

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Standard Profitability Item
- **Item**: Office Supplies
- **Purchase Value**: R$ 800.00 (without taxes)
- **Sale Value**: R$ 1,200.00 (without taxes)
- **Profitability**: (1,200 / 800) - 1 = 50%
- **Commission Bracket**: 50%-60% → **3%**
- **Commission Value**: R$ 1,200.00 × 0.03 = **R$ 36.00**

### Example 2: High Profitability Item
- **Item**: Premium Service
- **Purchase Value**: R$ 500.00 (without taxes)
- **Sale Value**: R$ 1,000.00 (without taxes)
- **Profitability**: (1,000 / 500) - 1 = 100%
- **Commission Bracket**: ≥80% → **5%**
- **Commission Value**: R$ 1,000.00 × 0.05 = **R$ 50.00**

### Example 3: Low Profitability Item
- **Item**: Commodity Product
- **Purchase Value**: R$ 900.00 (without taxes)
- **Sale Value**: R$ 1,000.00 (without taxes)
- **Profitability**: (1,000 / 900) - 1 = 11.1%
- **Commission Bracket**: <20% → **0%**
- **Commission Value**: R$ 1,000.00 × 0.00 = **R$ 0.00**
